1) Pritham Bhagauti Simar Kai
First, remembering the Primal Power (Bhagauti), meditate on Guru Nanak. Then, may Guru angad, Guru amar Das, and Guru Ram Das grant their aid. I remember Guru arjan and Guru Hargobind, and Sri Har Rai. Meditate on Sri Har Krishan, at whose very sight all sorrow departs. Remembering Guru Tegh Bahadur, the nine treasures hasten into the home. May help be present everywhere. (1) May the Tenth Sovereign, Sahib Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji, be our support in all places.
 
2) Naam Japo - Meditate on the Divine Name
In the Sikh path, “Naam Japo”—to remember and repeat the Divine Name—is a foundational principle. To grasp it, we first ask: What is “Naam” in Gurmat? In the spiritual order, “Naam” signifies the Supreme Reality. all the expanse is of the Naam, and by Naam the creation moves. The Mahan Kosh (Great Lexicon) notes under “Naam” that it is the Creator and the cognitive word of His Command (Hukam).
The Gurus instructed humankind to remember the Naam for spiritual growth and self-realization—keeping the Name and qualities of the Divine constantly alive in one’s awareness. In Gurmat, Naam is remembrance of the Timeless One alone. The Gurbani contains the Naam; by meditating upon it, one can reach the Naami—the akal Purakh Himself.
Before reciting, Gurbani first teaches us to recognize the Naam:
“They read, but the self-willed do not know the way;
they do not understand the Naam, and wander in delusion.”
(Marū, Guru Nanak, ang 1032)
Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji says to the yogi: the essence of religious discourse is this—without Naam there is no Yoga:
“Hear, O ascetic, the decision of the Word:
without the Name, there is no yoga.”
(Rag Ramkalī, ang 946)
In Sikhi, meditating on the Naam means to remain ever aware of the Divine’s presence—seeing the One as pervading all, unfathomable, all-powerful, merciful and just, and walking in His Will. One shapes life by the Guru’s teachings, sings the Creator’s praise, and lives by the Guru’s command.
Naam Japo does not mean abandoning the world and retreating to caves like ascetics to mutter the Name while torturing the body. Rather, Guru Sahib teaches:
“Understand forests and homes as one;
keep detachment in the mind itself.”
Thus, moving within society, one should practice Naam so that “laughing, playing, dressing, eating” one receives liberation.
Through Naam Simran, a person, disciplined in spirit, tastes inward peace, remaining untouched by worldly attachment. Singing the Lord’s virtues lights wisdom within; the Shabad-Guru comes to dwell in the heart. When the Shabad shines there, the restless mind receives the gift of steadiness. For this reason, the Gurus blessed the threefold path: “Naam Japo, Kirat Karo, Vand Chhako”—so that worldly life proceeds rightly and the soul’s purpose in coming to this world is fulfilled.
 
3) Kirat Karo — Earn by Honest Work
In Guru Nanak’s time, society’s religious, political, and economic fabric was tangled. Religious leaders had twisted faith so badly that ordinary people couldn’t follow it; rulers with influence strayed from rightful duty. Guru Sahib says:
“Modesty and righteousness stood hidden away; falsehood paraded as leader, O Lalo.”
To clear that darkness, the Guru took up the mission—described by Bhai Gurdas Ji as:
“He rose to transform a hidden earth.”
Guru Nanak’s principles were simple and doable for all. For the welfare of all humanity, the threefold doctrine—Kirat Karo (earn by honest labor), Naam Japo (remember the Name), Vand Chhako (share what you have)—proved immensely fruitful. These three are the lived expression of:
“Earn by toil, and out of your hands give.”
Guru Nanak says:
“Some, as householders, serve and practice; through the Guru’s wisdom they are attached.
They fix Naam, charity, and cleansing within, and awake to the Lord’s devotion.”
(Sri Guru Granth Sahib, ang 418)
“Kirat”—honest livelihood—is the ground that makes sharing possible. Only one who earns righteously can share righteously. In the Mul Mantar, feeling the Creator’s working nature, Guru Nanak calls the Timeless One “Karta”—the Doer. Being a spark of the Divine, working is the human being’s basic duty. The Sikh is to work with both hands—free of deceit or fraud—marked by honesty and sincere feeling. Wealth gathered by dishonest means can never bear true fruit:
“Without sins, one cannot live;
and nothing goes along with you when you die.”
(Sri Guru Granth Sahib, ang 417)
On his missionary journeys, Guru Nanak established this Gurmat principle of honest earning, and then gave it practical form by founding Kartarpur Sahib. The well-known account of Bhai Lalo and Chaudhary Malik Bhago teaches the Sikhs the worth of truthful work. In daily life, Gurmat tells us to remember the Divine while working, which is the central aim of life. The dialogue in Gurbani involving Bhagat Namdev Ji and Bhagat Trilochan Ji strengthens the Sikh to remember the Lord while doing one’s tasks:
Trilochan says: “Nama, friend, you are entangled in Maya—
Why do you patch leather? Why not fix your mind on the Lord?”
Namdev replies: “Trilochan, keep God upon your lips—
with hands and feet do all your work, but keep your consciousness with the Immaculate One.”
(Sri Guru Granth Sahib, ang 1375)
So for human progress, true work must be done. Work keeps one healthy and strong, deepens one’s grasp of the Creator’s play, and wards off sloth. Ever be industrious:
“Make effort, O soul, and enjoy the comfort you earn;
meditating on the Lord, you will meet Him, O Nanak, and anxiety will depart.”
(Sri Guru Granth Sahib, ang 522)
“Work with your hands; walk with your feet to the holy congregation.
Earn by righteous labor and share to nourish righteousness.”
(Varan Bhai Gurdas Ji, Var 1, Pauṛī 3)
 
4) Vand Chhako — Share What You Have
Vand Chhako is part of the Gurmat threefold principle (Naam Japo, Kirat Karo, Vand Chhako). In lexicons, “Vand” can mean to separate, to apportion, a portion; “Chhakkṇa” means to eat, partake, be satisfied. The Gurmat Nirṇay Kosh defines it thus: “Using appropriately what you possess for the help of those in need is called Vand Chhakkṇa.”
From these meanings, Vand Chhako emerges as: taking an equal portion from what you have and giving it to one in need or one who wishes to partake. The concept springs from Guru Nanak’s line:
“By toil earn your living, and from your hands give.”
Here, Vand Chhako is “hathahu dei”—give from your hands. Sri Guru arjan Dev Ji emphasizes its importance:
“Eat and spend together, O brothers;
there will be no loss—it will only increase.”
Bhai Gurdas Ji, interpreter of Gurmat, writes:
“Earn by toil, and the Gursikhs eat together.”
“Eating together” is exactly Vand Chhako. In the Gurus’ time, every Sikh lived this principle. In the era of Guru amar Das Ji, both Vand Chhako and offerings (kar-bhet) existed; over time, daswandh (giving one-tenth) took shape, likely inspired by Vand Chhako. In Gurmat, Vand Chhako and daswandh each has its own identity—daswandh is offered for the Guru’s cause:
“Whatever you earn,
give a tenth for the Guru’s sake.”
(Bhai Santokh Singh, Sri Gur Pratap Sūraj Granth)
When Guru amar Das Ji began the digging of the Goindwal Baolī, Sikhs used to bring kar-bhet before the Guru:
“One day, in the assembly, he proclaimed,
‘Here, the baoli will bring salvation…’
The Guru prepared for the holy work;
blessed ones came forward for service…
a great gathering of the Sangat assembled;
each, to his capacity, brought offerings.”
(Sri Gur Pratap Sūraj Granth)
Even today, daswandh belongs to the Guru Panth and can be used for its causes; Vand Chhako preserved its independent identity then as now, as we see in Guru arjan’s Bani and Bhai Gurdas’s Vars. Sharing strengthens bonds among Sikhs and the wider community—ties we so often lack today.
Rehatnamas mention Vand Chhako. Bhai Prahlad Singh writes:
“Let the Sikh distribute the blessed food;
for such a Sikh the Guru would give his very life.”
Thus, whoever guards this principle wins the Guru’s pleasure. In the 18th century, even amidst persecution and exile, the Khalsa did not forget to share; after preparing langar, they would call out loudly so that the needy and hungry ate first, then they themselves.
Bhai Ratan Singh Bhangu records that Sikhs always shared—no Singh ate alone or in secret; if one had food, all ate together; otherwise they would keep langar going:
“If he had (food), he opened his hand and gave; if not, he would not eat alone.
It has ever been the Khalsa’s way: none eats secretly or alone.
If there is but one (share), all eat together; otherwise, they call it the ‘langar of contentment.’
First offer openly, then eat; loving the Singhs, call them together.”
(Ratan Singh Bhangu, Sri Gur Panth Prakash)
Vand Chhako teaches us to live beyond caste, creed, religion, color, race—showing equal regard to all. Through the Guru’s insistence on sharing, we can build a global brotherhood, sorely needed today.
 
5) “Shabad Guru, Surat Dhun Chela” — The Word is the Guru; Consciousness, the Disciple of Its Melody
The eleventh Sikh Guru is the Sri Guru Granth Sahib, the eternal spiritual Guru of the Sikhs—not a person but the sacred scripture containing the Bani of the Sikh Gurus and saints. It teaches truth, equality, devotion, and humility. Sikhs seek timeless guidance from it.
 
6) The Battle of Chappar Chiri
To chastise tyranny, the Tenth Guru sent Baba Banda Singh Bahadur toward Punjab, blessing him with five arrows and placing him under the command of the Panj Singh. as the Singhs gathered and fought battles, the day arrived when Wazir Khan—who had martyred the Younger Sahibzade—would be faced in the field.
at Chappar Chiri, a fierce battle raged. Until noon, the Singhs dominated; but because Wazir Khan had much larger forces and artillery, the tide began turning against the Singhs in the afternoon. Seeing this, Baba Baaz Singh urged Baba Banda Singh, who was observing from a high mound, to enter the fray so the battle would again turn in their favor and the tyrant receive justice. Banda Singh prayed before Guru Sahib and mounted his horse. as recorded in Sri Gur Panth Prakash:
“Smiling, Banda called for his horse, saying, ‘Master, I have arrived.’
‘Strike! Seize! Plunder!’—so saying, he loosed the arrow.”
Firing one of the arrows blessed by the Guru, Baba Ji changed the course of the battlefield. Soon the Singhs were victorious; they captured Wazir Khan, took him to Sirhind, and punished him.
(The brief English summary you included is consistent with the above.)
 
7) Baba Banda Singh Bahadur
Baba Banda Singh Bahadur was a great Sikh warrior and martyr, born 16 October 1670 in Rajouri (Jammu) to a Rajput family. In youth, after a painful incident in which he killed a pregnant doe, his heart changed. Leaving home to become an ascetic known as Madho Das Bairagi, he eventually settled at Nanded in Maharashtra.
In 1708, Guru Gobind Singh Ji visited his hut. Madho Das tried to impress the Guru with sorcery but failed; humbled, he said, “I am your Banda (servant).” The Guru urged him to leave asceticism and fight for Dharma. On 3 September 1708, the Guru administered Khande-di-Pahul and named him Banda Singh Bahadur, sending him to Punjab to end Mughal tyranny, especially to punish Nawab Wazir Khan.
Under the guidance of five Singhs—Baaz Singh, Ram Singh, Binod Singh, Kahan Singh, and Fateh Singh—the Guru gave him five golden arrows and a hukamnama. Banda Singh distributed captured state treasuries at Sonipat and Kaithal among the poor; he struck Samana (home of executioners of Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji and the younger Sahibzade), his first territorial victory and administrative unit; he destroyed Sadhora (where Syed Buddhu Shah had been tormented), where many were killed in a place called “Qatal Garhi.”
On 12 May 1710, at Chappar Chiri, he defeated Wazir Khan’s large army; Wazir Khan was killed, and Sirhind fell the next day. Banda made Lohgarh the capital of the first Sikh state, issued coins, and—most importantly—abolished the feudal landlord system to establish peasant proprietorship.
The Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah launched reprisals. Banda was driven from the plains and besieged at Gurdas Nangal. after eight months of heroic resistance and the exhaustion of provisions and ammunition, Banda Singh and about 740 Sikhs were captured on 17 December 1715, marched in chains to Delhi, and paraded. On 9 June 1716, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur was martyred in Delhi with his young son ajay Singh.
 
8) Bhai Tara Singh of Van — The Battle
In the third decade of the 18th century, the battle fought by Bhai Tara Singh of Van and his band in Van village ranks among the stirring engagements of Sikh history. Guarding Sikh tradition, he fought and attained martyrdom.
Likely born around 1702 to Bhai Gurdas Singh, who had served Guru Har Rai and later supported Sikh campaigns under Banda Singh Bahadur, Bhai Tara Singh was the eldest of five brothers. He took Khande-di-Pahul under Bhai Mani Singh’s leadership. He built a fortified enclosure (vaṛa) on his fields near Van—so high that even a man on a camel couldn’t peer inside.
after Banda Singh’s martyrdom, the Sikhs adopted guerrilla tactics—by day hiding in forests, by night striking and melting away. Bands operating near Van would rest and eat at Bhai Tara Singh’s enclosure before slipping away again before dawn. The state kept close watch on such Sikhs. a quarrel with local official Sahib Rai Nausheria brought the matter to Ja‘far Beg, the faujdar of Patti. His first raid failed; he then asked Zakirya Khan, governor of Lahore, for help. Zakirya Khan sent Moman Khan with 2200 cavalry and war materiel to attack.
The Singhs learned of the approach. In council, they judged the imperial army too numerous and well-armed; prudence suggested withdrawing to forests like other bands. Bhai Tara Singh set out toward Malwa; reaching near Bahadur Nagar to ford the Sutlej, his conscience would not let him flee. Taking out a Dasam Granth he always kept in his coffer, he drew a Gurbani line for guidance:
“If one could escape death by fleeing from Time,
tell me—why run away?”
(Sri Dasam Granth)
Deeply struck, he abandoned the plan to withdraw, returned with his band, and held the enclosure. Moman Khan arrived. at amrit-vela, the Singhs beat the war-drum; their cry “akal!” shook the sky. Only about twenty-two Singhs stood against vastly more. They fought fiercely—Taqi Beg was wounded by Bhai Tara Singh’s hand. Many Mughals fell. Moman Khan then ordered a united charge. One by one, the Singhs attained martyrdom in the field; at last, Bhai Tara Singh too fell fighting. This occurred around 1725–26. The Sikhs of that century, sheltered by the Shabad-Guru, chose martyrdom over flight. The memorial “Shaheed Ganj” of Bhai Tara Singh and his comrades stands in Van.
 
9) The Battle of the Women of Chavinda (Chavinde)
In 1726, a Turk named Ja‘far Beg, after being badly beaten by a small band of Sikhs near Naushehra over a tax dispute, fled toward amritsar. Burning with shame, he sought an excuse for revenge and heard that in Chavinde, at the wedding of Sardar Bahadur Singh’s son, many **Sikhs—men and women—**had gathered. He surrounded the village with his defeated force. The Sikhs, however, completed the anand ceremony undisturbed; then, after langar, the mounted Khalsa struck a flank of the encircling troops, cut many down, and broke out.
Twice thwarted, Ja‘far Beg’s malice turned vile; he stormed the house to assault the women. Inside were twenty Sikh women. at once they fortified the house like a small fort. They barred the door; two stood at Ja‘far Beg’s side, two kept watch on every angle, two were tasked with distributing supplies as needed, and fourteen readied muskets and bows, waiting.
The moment came. as the first contingent advanced at Ja‘far Beg’s signal, a rain of bullets and arrows fell—true to the mark—throwing the troops into confusion. Ja‘far Beg had not imagined such resistance. When powder ran low, the arrows still came in sheets. He then pushed close with fifty soldiers to the wall. The women drew their swords. In this hand-to-hand clash, the lightning-fast blades unnerved the enemy.
Bibi Dharam Kaur, wed barely two hours before, cut down many and, though grievously wounded, fell. Hoping to salvage some “prize,” Ja‘far Beg reached to seize her; with a flash of her sword, she severed his arm. Screaming, he ran; his troops broke and fled.
In this uneven fight, only four women were wounded—yet they showed the world how the Guru’s amrit makes sparrows strike like hawks.
 
10) The Martyrdom of Bhai Mani Singh
Bhai Mani Singh was born in 1644 at alipur (now in Pakistan) to Bhai Mai Das and Madhri Bai. Of twelve sons, his brother Bhai Dayala was martyred with Guru Tegh Bahadur at Chandni Chowk, Delhi. Bhai Mani Singh married Bibi Seeto; five sons were born to them—Uday Singh, ajab Singh, ajaib Singh, anokh Singh, and Bachittar Singh. His son Bachittar Singh famously pierced the armored war-elephant with a naagni spear during the defense of Lohgarh at anandpur.
at age thirteen, Bhai Mani Singh went with his father to serve Guru Har Rai, doing daily langar service and devotional practice. He also served Guru Har Krishan, accompanying him to Delhi to spread Gurmat. Under Guru Tegh Bahadur and later Guru Gobind Singh, he excelled in martial skills, copying Gurbani, and katha (exposition). His gentle nature, obedience, and steadfastness in Sikhi won him great respect at the Guru’s court.
a leading Sikh under the Tenth Master, he fought bravely at Bhangani, Nadaun, and anandpur. The Guru honored him with the title of “Diwan”. at the founding of the Khalsa, he and his five sons received amrit. at the request of the amritsar Sangat, the Guru appointed him Granthi of Sri Harimandar Sahib and Jathedar of akal Takht Sahib. He organized the shrines according to Gurmat Maryada. after the Guru left anandpur, Bhai Mani Singh went first to Delhi, then to Takht Sri Damdama Sahib (Talwandi Sabo), serving during the re-editing of Sri Guru Granth Sahib as scribe. after the Guru’s Joti Jot (merging with the Light), he settled at amritsar.
after Banda Singh’s martyrdom, Mughal rule inflicted terrible losses on the Sikhs and banned the Diwali and Vaisakhi gatherings at amritsar. The Khalsa took refuge in forests and hills. To reunite the Panth and plan ahead, Bhai Mani Singh sought permission from the Lahore governor to hold a Diwali gathering at amritsar; it was granted on condition of a tax of five thousand. The state planned to massacre the Sikhs when they assembled; sensing this, Bhai Mani Singh warned the Sikhs not to come.
after Diwali, the government demanded the tax. Bhai Mani Singh refused. arrested and taken to Lahore, he was offered bribes and threats to convert, but he remained unshaken in the Guru’s Will. On 25 Harh 1734 CE, the executioners cut him joint by joint (band-band) at Nakhas Chowk, Lahore—a martyrdom that kindled the Panth’s spirit and intensified the Sikh struggle against the Mughals.
 
11) Bhai Garja Singh and Bhai Bota Singh
From Bhadhaṇe (Bhraḍhaṇe) in the Majha, Bhai Garja Singh (a Ranghreta) and Bhai Bota Singh (a farmer) were valiant warriors. When Zakirya Khan became governor of Lahore, he imposed bounties on Sikh heads. Many Sikhs hid in forests or crossed the Sutlej; Garja Singh and Bota Singh stayed in the Majha, slipping secretly to amritsar and Tarn Taran for darshan and ishnan.
One day near Nuruddin’s sarai close to Tarn Taran, they overheard two travelers say, “There seem to be Singhs behind those bushes.” The other replied, “They cannot be Singhs, for Singhs don’t hide. Zakirya Khan had it proclaimed that the Sikhs are finished—these must be thieves or cowards.” Nervous, the travelers hurried on.
Cut to the heart, the two Singhs resolved to prove that the Khalsa still lived. Fashioning stout cudgels from berry wood, they set up a Khalsa toll on the royal road between Delhi and Lahore near the sarai, collecting one ana per cart and one paisa per donkey. Travelers paid silently; those who asked were told, “This is the Khalsa’s toll.” No one dared resist. But no traveler reported it to Zakirya Khan. after many days with no government response, the Singhs sent a letter to Zakirya Khan through a passerby:
“This letter writes Singh Bota:
a staff in hand, I stand in the road.
One ana for the cart, one paisa for the donkey—
Tell Sister-in-law Khan that so says Singh Bota.”
Reading it, Zakirya Khan fumed, dispatching Jalaluddin with one hundred ready soldiers to arrest them. Surrounded, the faujdar advised surrender, return the collections, and accept pardon; but the Singhs replied, “a Sikh bows to none but the Guru. Do what you can with your force.” The first group of five soldiers was cut down, then the next. The Singhs seized their swords and pressed Jalaluddin.
Ordered to take them alive, the troops finally resorted to musket fire. Even grievously wounded, the Singhs stood their ground until they fell. Fearing they might rise again, the soldiers hesitated to approach; only when certain of their martyrdom did they advance, then hacked their bodies to pieces. This occurred around 1739 CE. Their stand proclaimed that the Khalsa lives—eternal and unfading.
 
12) The Martyrdom of Bhai Taru Singh
Bhai Taru Singh was a devoted practitioner of Naam, charitable, and idealistic. Born in 1720 at Puhla (district Tarn Taran) to Bhai Jodh Singh, a farming family, his mother imbued him from childhood with Gurbani and Sikh history, planting unshakable faith and zeal for serving the Sikhs. Farming honestly, he helped the needy from his earnings and remained immersed in Gurbani practice. People around him were deeply influenced, and all respected him.
Governor Zakirya Khan was committing atrocities against the Sikhs. after Massa Ranghar, who desecrated Harmandir Sahib, was punished by Bhai Sukha Singh and Bhai Mehtab Singh, Zakirya Khan raged. Spies were everywhere, paid in wealth and favors. On the slander of Haribhagat Niranjania from Jandiala (accusing him of aiding Singhs), Moman Khan arrested Bhai Taru Singh and took him to Lahore. He was pressed to convert to Islam with threats and inducements, but he never wavered. With steadfast faith in Gurmat, he prayed to keep Sikhi with hair and breath and to remain in Chardi Kala.
Seeing his resolve, the qazi ordered his hair cut. Bhai Taru Singh declared he would not allow such desecration. at Nakhas Chowk (Lahore), the executioner flayed his scalp with his hair using a rasping tool. Bhai Sahib remained absorbed in Waheguru, unshaken. By Divine Will, Zakirya Khan suffered a blockage of urine; despite medicine, he did not recover. Remorseful for his tyranny, he sent Bhai Subeg Singh with five thousand rupees to the Singhs at Kahnuwan to seek a remedy. Nawab Kapur Singh, consulting the Sikhs, said: “If Bhai Taru Singh’s shoe strikes Zakirya Khan’s head, the blockage may open.” after the shoe was applied, the blockage cleared—but Zakirya Khan lived only four more days.
Bhai Taru Singh lived 22 days after losing his scalp, and on 1 Savan 1745 CE, he departed. He bore countless tortures rather than accept oppression, declaring to the world that a Sikh’s hair is dearer than life. a Sikh may lay down his life, but cannot bear dishonor to a single hair. Inspired by his martyrdom, we should care for and honor our kesh—the Guru’s seal.
 

13) The “Small Holocaust” (Chhoṭa Ghallūghara, 1746)
Ghallūghara—extermination by tyrants—aptly names the two 18th century genocides inflicted on the Sikhs. The first (1746, Kahnūwan area) cost fewer than the second (1762, Kup Raheera), hence they are remembered as Small and Great Ghallūghara.
after Zakariya Khan’s death, his son Yahiya Khan became Lahore’s governor—equally bent on Sikh annihilation. His diwan Lakhpat Rai (whose brother Jaspat Rai was faujdar of Eminabad) spearheaded the campaign. When Jaspat Rai was beheaded in battle by Bhai Nibhahu Singh, Lakhpat Rai swore bare headed in court to avenge him and destroy Sikh Dharma, even banning words like “Guru” and “Granth.”
Learning that a large Sikh jatha with women, elders, and children (15–20,000) had gathered in the Kahnūwan forest, the Mughal army first cleared the dense woods to bring in artillery. The Sikhs answered bravely but were pressed towards Parol and Kathūa; supplies ran out. With Ravi on one side, hills on another, and armies behind, the Sikhs decided: the foot bound should climb the hills, the able swim the Ravi, the horsemen fight through to the plains. Many perished in the Ravi’s current; others fell to hill tribes alerted by Lahore. Pursued through Harigobindpur, adīna Beg harried the crossing of the Beas. By May, thousands were dead; three thousand were captured and later executed at Lahore’s Nakhas Chowk. The Panth remembers these martyrs each year on 3 Jeṭh.
 
14) Formation of the Dal Khalsa
after Banda Singh’s forces dispersed, Sikh fighters continued as small, swift guerrilla jathas, uniting when needed—especially on Vaisakhi and Diwalī in amritsar under Dīvan Darbara Singh. In 1733, Zakariya Khan, failing to crush them, offered a compromise—bestowing the title Nawab on Bhai Kapūr Singh, whom the Sikhs accepted as leader. For administration, he divided the force into:
•	Buḍḍha Dal (veterans)


•	Taruna Dal (youth)—later into five jathas.


When truce broke in 1735, the Khalsa re scattered. after ahmad Shah Durrani’s invasion (1747), 29 March 1748 (Vaisakhi) in amritsar, the Khalsa—by Gurmata—united its fighting strength as the Dal Khalsa, appointing Sardar Jassa Singh ahluwalia as supreme leader. Sixty five jathas were consolidated into eleven Misls, each with its own standard:
•	ahluwalia — S. Jassa Singh ahluwalia


•	Faizullapuria — Nawab Kapūr Singh


•	Shukarchakkīa — S. Naudh Singh


•	Nishanwalia — S. Dasaunda Singh


•	Bhaṅgī — S. Harī Singh


•	Kanaiha — S. Jai Singh Kanhaiya


•	Nakkai — S. Hīra Singh


•	Dallewalia — S. Gulab Singh


•	Shaheedī — Baba Dīp Singh Ji


•	Karor Singhīa — S. Karora Singh


•	Ramgaṛhia — S. Nand Singh / S. Jassa Singh Ramgaṛhia


These Misls fell within Buḍḍha Dal and Taruna Dal; on joint campaigns, the Nishanwalia carried the Panthic standard.
Within years the Dal Khalsa controlled much of Punjab; by 1755 their protective levies (rakhī) reached far. Even after the Great Ghallughara (1762), the Khalsa humbled the Durranis—seizing Sirhind, Multan, and Lahore by 1764–65. From 1708–1769, relentless armed struggle brought down the three great powers—Durrani, Mughal, and Maratha—and established Sikh sovereignty in Punjab.
 
15) Baba Deep Singh Ji’s Battle
Born 14 Magh 1682 at Pahuwind (Tarn Taran) to Bhai Bhagta and Mata Jiunī, Baba Dīp Singh was trained in scripture and arms—Gurmukhi, arabic, Persian—writing sacred volumes and teaching children while serving langar. after taking amrit with family at anandpur, he served Guru Gobind Singh at Damdama Sahib (Talwandi Sabo), assisting in the final recension of Guru Granth Sahib, carrying reed pens and paper.
Made Jathedar of Takht Sri Damdama Sahib, he was tasked to teach Gurmat and Shastar Vidya and to strengthen Panthic leadership. In 1748, when the Dal Khalsa formed and the Panth was organized into 12 Misls, Baba Dīp Singh was appointed head of the Shaheedī Misl with headquarters at Talwandi Sabo.
In 1756, after Durrani’s fourth invasion, his son Taimūr Shah desecrated Sikh shrines—filling the sacred sarovar at amritsar. Hearing this, Baba Dīp Singh set out with 500 Singhs; at Tarn Taran the force rose to 5,000. He said: “Let only those come further who value the sanctity of the shrines more than life itself.” at Gohlwar, they clashed with Zahan Khan; casualties were heavy on both sides, but the Singhs pressed on. Baba Ji, grievously wounded, had vowed to offer his head at the feet of Sri Guru Ram Das—and fighting through, he reached Sri Harimandar Sahib, fulfilled his vow, and attained martyrdom on 30 Kattak 1757.
 
16) The “Great Holocaust” (Vaḍḍa Ghallūghara, 1762)
among the era’s most searing events, the Great Ghallūghara occurred at Kup—Raheera. ahmad Shah abdali invaded India eight times (1747–1767). after crushing the Marathas at Panipat (1761), he viewed the Sikhs as his main obstacle. While he returned through Punjab, the Khalsa relentlessly harried his columns, recapturing plunder. Soon after, the Khalsa overran much of Punjab—toppling abdali’s officers in Sirhind, Lahore, Jalandhar Doab, Malerkotla.
Seeking to “end” the Sikhs, abdali advanced again. Under leaders like Jassa Singh ahluwalia, Jassa Singh Ramgaṛhia, Harī Singh Bhaṅgī, Jai Singh Kanhaiya, Charhat Singh Shukarchakkīa, the Khalsa’s first priority was to protect the non combatant caravan (women, children, elders)—which had grown to perhaps 50,000 near Malerkotla.
In February 1762, at Kup—Raheera, abdali and allied Punjab chieftains encircled the caravan. Sikh warriors formed a human cordon and fought while shepherding the caravan onward. The ring broke under repeated assaults; thousands of innocents were butchered. On 27 Magh 1762, perhaps 30,000 Sikhs were slain. Returning to Lahore, abdali demolished Sri Harimandar Sahib and filled the sarovar.
The loss was immense—but the Khalsa spirit did not break. Within five to six months, they were back in amritsar, defying abdali once more. The Panth remembers these martyrs each year on 27 Magh.
 
17) Akalī — The Timeless Order
“We are akalī—answerable only to the Timeless;
Our Panth is distinct.
We took up the double edged sword
for the dharma of the poor and oppressed.”
When the Sixth Guru, Sri Guru Harigobind, manifested akal Bunga (later akal Takht), he also began the akalī soldiery. after the Khalsa’s creation, the akalī tradition reached its zenith: Buḍḍha Dal, Shaheedan Misl, and Baba Bir Singh of Naurangabad upheld its standards. Under colonial rule, attempts were made to suppress akalī spirit; a new “akali Dal” emerged c.1920 with worthy early service, but over time many strayed from the original akalī ideals. Today it is vital to revive those ideals.
Core qualities of an akalī:
•	anchored in the Timeless One alone.


•	a lover of Naam and Baṇī, continuously nourishing the Sangat with kirtan and true Gurmat.


•	Detached, renunciate in spirit—serving without hunger for position or fame.


•	Views resources, homes, land as Divine trust, not private hoard.


•	Life marked by inner Sehaj, spiritual stature, selfless service, righteous struggle, and dharma parchar—naturally earning the Sangat’s esteem.


•	Ever ready—service is not bound to time or place.


•	Fearless, beyond enmity—living “already a martyr.”


•	In former days, mere sight of a true akalī drew hearts God ward—no lectures needed.


•	Never oppressor, never passive victim—beyond coercion.


•	Historically, akalī and Nihang are one term.


 
18) Sardar Jassa Singh Ramgaṛhia
a towering 18th century general and founder of the Ramgaṛhia Misl, Jassa Singh was born 5 May 1723 at Ichhogil (Lahore) to Giani Bhagwan Singh in a family of weapon smiths devoted to the Guru. His grandfather had taken amrit from Guru Gobind Singh and fought with Banda Singh. Orphaned by Nadir Shah’s depredations, Jassa Singh joined Nand Singh Sanghania’s jatha, mastering arms; he briefly served adīna Beg (Jalandhar Doab), a move later repented.
In 1748, when 500 Sikhs sheltered in a hastily built mud fort Ram Raunī at amritsar and were surrounded by Mīr Mannū, Jassa Singh left adīna’s employ, helped lift the siege through Diwan Kaura Mal, sought the Panth’s pardon, and rejoined. after Mannū’s death (1753), amidst anarchy, he rebuilt Ram Raunī and renamed it Ramgaṛh—earning the title “Ramgaṛhia” and forming his Misl. He fought ahmad Shah Durrani many times, holding Kangra, Hoshiarpur, and between Ravi and Beas, making Sri Hargobindpur his capital. among his greatest feats: in 1783, after the Sikh conquest of Delhi, he brought back the Mughal coronation slab (takhṭ stone)—today preserved in the Ramgaṛhia Bunga at Sri Darbar Sahib. He passed in 1803 at age 80.
 
19) Shastar Dhari — Bearing arms with Conscience
Sikh resort to force does not spring from hatred or vengeance, but from moral duty against tyranny, injustice, and religious persecution. The Sikh does not wield violence for territory, private vendetta, or power lust. Every action is governed by an ideal—Sarbat da Bhala (the welfare of all). Thus taking up the sword is a last resort, when all other means fail.
Worldly empires (Hitler, Stalin, imperial courts) have unleashed violence born of fear, greed, or ethnic cleansing. Sikh use of force is creative and protective—it destroys evil yet saves humanity. The Gurus forbade harm to the defenseless—women, children, the elderly, the unarmed. Violence is justified only for truth and righteousness. Guru Nanak called Babar’s terror a “yoke of sin”—framing violence within moral scrutiny. The Sikh struggle may take many forms—open battles, martyrdom, guerrilla resistance—but its aim is the Guru’s pleasure and the good of all. Precisely because of this ethical power, rulers often targeted the Panth’s spiritual centers (akal Takht, saintly lineages). against state treachery, the Khalsa’s moral force stands high.
 
20) Death of Zain Khan and the Capture of Sirhind (1764)
Zain Khan, faujdar of Sirhind (after 1761), had been a prime hand in the Great Ghallughara. In late 1763, the Sarbat Khalsa resolved to punish Sirhind. Under Jassa Singh ahluwalia, with Ramgaṛhia, Bhaṅgī, Shukarchakkīa, Kanaiha and others, the Singhs crossed the Sutlej at Ropar, gathered at Sri Chamkaur Sahib, chastised the Ranghars who had betrayed Mata Gujri Ji and the Sahibzadas, and advanced.
On 13–14 January 1764, the Singhs set a watch at Manheṛe to intercept Zain Khan returning from tax raids. The Buḍḍha Dal blocked him near Bhaganpur; the Taruna Dal maintained a cordon. Zain Khan tried to slip into Sirhind with a detachment while drums sounded elsewhere to mislead. Reading the ruse, the Singhs were ready. Shots struck Zain Khan from his horse; Tara Singh of Maṛī beheaded him. His troops fled; the Singhs entered Sirhind and took it—seizing the treasury and securing the surrounding districts. It was a decisive triumph in the 18th century Sikh rise.
 
21) Patshahi — Badshahi (Sovereignty under the Guru’s Canopy)
The Guru Khalsa Panth arose by the Timeless Lord’s grace and bows to akal Purakh alone. Its temporal center is Sri akal Takht Sahib; its dominion is without limit. Earthly thrones remain in balance beneath the Khalsa’s spiritual canopy.
a courtier once said to Maharaja Ranjit Singh, “Patshah, you are our emperor—should we servants wear the patka (scarf), not you?” The Maharaja asked, “Whose coin circulates?” “The state’s Nanak shahi coin,” came the reply. The Lion of Punjab smiled: “The one in whose name the coin runs is the Patshah. I am but the humble servant of Guru Nanak; always at His command, girded for service. By His grace alone do I serve the Panth. The true Emperor is the Satguru.”

(Heading retained as in the original.)
 
23) The Court of Maharaja Ranjit Singh
The Maharaja’s court—Darbar e Khalsa or Sarkar e Khalsa—was the vibrant center of a vast Sikh state, convening at Lahore Fort’s Diwan e am and the Saman Burj, among the most orderly and prosperous courts of the age. Remarkably inclusive, it featured Sikh generals (Harī Singh Nalwa, akalī Phūla Singh), Hindu Dogra vazirs (Dhiyan Singh, Gulab Singh), Muslim officers (Faqīr aziz ud Din, Faqīr Nūr ud Din), and European commanders (Ventura, allard). Each morning the Maharaja heard reports from all provinces, then civil, military, revenue, and judicial matters—working late into the evening. Though powerful, he sat on a simple chair, counting himself a sevak of Sarkar e Khalsa and honoring all visitors.
It was also a cultural court—a haven for art, literature, and scholarship. The celebrated painting by august Schoefft (based on 1841 sketches and completed 1845–55) shows the Maharaja receiving nazr in the asht Dara pavilion outside Sheesh Mahal at the octagonal Saman Burj, surrounded by royalty, courtiers, and European officers—a vision of a cosmopolitan Sikh court.
 
24) Akali Phoola Singh Ji
Born January 1761 at Dehla Sīhaṅ (Sangrūr) to S. Īsher Singh and Mata Har Kaur of the Nishanwalia Misl, Phūla Singh was raised by Baba Naina Singh after his father fell fighting abdali’s forces. Trained in Gurbanī, horsemanship, and Shastar Vidya, he rose to leadership after Baba Naina Singh’s passing and was acknowledged Jathedar of Sri akal Takht Sahib. He also served Takht Kesgarh Sahib and Damdama Sahib.
By 1800, he and his jatha camped at amritsar, mediating between competing sardars (Bhaṅgīs and Ramgaṛhias) and preventing fratricidal war—which won him great honor and the respect of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Two themes mark his life: unyielding Sikh maryada and firm protection/expansion of Khalsa rule. In 1809, when Muslim soldiers in Metcalfe’s entourage violated the longstanding maryada by taking a tazia past Harimandar Sahib, he confronted them—an incident personally diffused by the Maharaja, and never repeated. When the Maharaja lapsed in maryada, Jathedar Phūla Singh summoned him to akal Takht, where the Maharaja accepted tankhah (religious penance).
akalī Phūla Singh and his jatha joined every major campaign: Kasur, attock, Multan, Kashmir, and finally Naushahra (Pakistan), where he attained martyrdom on 14 March 1823—pressing forward after ardas though strategy counselled delay. His shaheedi wrote a new page in Sikh history: after prayer, a Sikh does not turn back.
 
25) Sardar Hari Singh Nalwa
Born 1791 at Gujranwala to S. Gurdiyal Singh and Dharam Kaur, Harī Singh—lion slayer, hence “Nalwa”—rose from youth to the Khalsa army’s Commander in Chief and Governor. Joining the army after impressing the Maharaja on Basant Panchami (1805), he led in the conquests of Kasur, Multan, attock, Kashmir, and more, governing Kashmir and even issuing coinage.
To quell Pathan depredations he founded Haripur (Hazara), and after taking Peshawar he built Jamrud Fort (Oct 1836). alarmed, Kabul’s Dost Muhammad sent forces under Mirza Shami Khan; the afghans attacked Jamrud in april 1837. With the court distracted by Prince Nau Nihal’s wedding, reinforcements lagged. Despite illness, Harī Singh rushed from Peshawar, divided his force, and struck with such speed that afghans fled towards Khyber. In the pursuit, hidden marksmen mortally wounded him. He returned into Jamrud and passed 30 april 1837. The news was concealed till after victory. The Maharaja lamented, “Today a mighty bastion of the Khalsa has fallen.” Harī Singh spent his life expanding and consolidating the Khalsa Raj.
 
26) Maharani Jind Kaur
Wife of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and mother of the last Sikh Maharaja, Duleep Singh, Jind Kaur (b. 1817, Chhaṛ, Sialkot) was wed in 1835; Duleep was born 6 Sept 1838; Ranjit Singh died 1839. after years of Dogra intrigue and assassinations (Kharak Singh, Nau Nihal Singh, Sher Singh, Ranī Chand Kaur), the child Duleep Singh ascended on 18 Sept 1843 under her regency. She rearranged the ministry to counter treachery—appointing her brother Jawahar Singh and Gulab Singh as vazirs. alarmed by her resolve, the British moved to weaken her.
after Sobraon (1846) and humiliating terms, the British separated mother and son—imprisoning her at Lahore, then Sheikhupura, Benares, and finally Chunar. She escaped in april 1849, reaching Nepal, remaining there twelve years, still encouraging resistance. In 1860, the British permitted correspondence; mother and son reunited at Calcutta (Dec 1860/april 1861) and went to England. Her presence rekindled Duleep’s Sikh spirit. In old age she lost her sight and passed on 1 aug 1863, requesting her remains not be left in England; in 1927, her granddaughter Princess Bamba interred her ashes near Ranjit Singh’s samadh in Lahore. The Maharani’s courage—prison over capitulation—stands out in history.
 
27) Kunwar Nau Nihal Singh
Born 1821 to Maharaja Kharak Singh and Ranī Chand Kaur, the Prince received training in languages, Sikh history, maryada, and arms (from Harī Singh Nalwa, Lehna Singh Majīthia, General Ventura). He commanded a picked corps, governed Peshawar and attock, and quelled rebellions in 1835. Deeply devout, he endowed works at Tarn Taran and laid stonework at Sri Darbar Sahib. In 1839, he led forces to Kabul, installing Shah Shuja.
after Ranjit Singh’s death, Kharak Singh became Maharaja; court intrigues—fanned by Dhian Singh Dogra—created fissures. On 5 Nov 1840, Kharak Singh died. as Nau Nihal returned from the cremation, a suspicious gateway collapse at Hazuri Bagh injured him lightly—but he was later murdered under cover of injury (8 Nov 1840). a promising ruler was lost to Dogra intrigue.
 
28) Maharaja Duleep Singh
Youngest of Ranjit Singh’s seven sons, Duleep Singh (b. 5 Feb 1837 to Maharani Jind Kaur) was placed on the throne on 16 Dec 1843 by Hira Singh Dogra, with his mother as regent. amid palace murders and British designs, the anglo Sikh wars (1845–49) ended with annexation; the child Maharaja was deposed, taken to Fatehgarh, and converted under pressure. In 1854 he was sent to England. after 13 years, he met his mother in Calcutta (1860/61) and took her with him. Later, guided by S. Thakur Singh Sandhawalia, he moved towards reclaiming Sikh identity and sovereignty—only to be blocked, detained at aden (1886), and deprived of pension. He died in Paris, 22 Oct 1893—a tragic prince longed for Punjab but kept away.
 
29) Anglo–Sikh Wars — The Battle of Mudkī & Beyond (1845–49)
after Maharaja Ranjit Singh (d. 1839), internal strife and court murders weakened the state, while the British strengthened along the Satluj. War began when Sikh forces crossed the river in December 1845.
First anglo–Sikh War (1845–46):
•	Mudkī (18 Dec 1845): a fierce first clash—heavy British loss, narrow British win, aided by Lal Singh’s treachery.


•	Firozshah (21–22 Dec 1845): the war’s most terrible fight; British defeat seemed certain—Governor General Hardinge prepared to flee—until Lal Singh and Teja Singh deserted at night; victory was snatched.


•	Baddowal (21 Jan 1846): Ranjodh Singh Majīthia enveloped a British column—burning much material; a Sikh success.


•	Aliwal (28 Jan 1846): Harry Smith defeated Ranjodh Singh.


•	Sobraon (10 Feb 1846): decisive; despite Sham Singh attariwala’s epic valor and martyrdom, Teja Singh treacherously broke the boat bridge—the army was trapped; the war ended with the Treaty of Lahore and loss of sovereignty. During Mudkī and Ferozshah, Baba Hanuman Singh led 3,200 akalis at the Maharani’s call, declaring war on the British and traitors.


Second Anglo–Sikh War (1848–49):
Sparked by Diwan Mūl Raj’s revolt at Multan, it soon spread.
•	Ramnagar (22 Nov 1848): indecisive, losses on both sides (leadership: Sher Singh attariwala).


•	Chillīanwala (13 Jan 1849): among the bloodiest; a tactical Sikh victory with heavy British casualties (Gen. Gough).


•	Multan (Jan 1849): fell to the British.


•	Gujrat (21 Feb 1849): “battle of artillery”—British firepower crushed Sikh forces; surrender followed. On 29 March 1849, Punjab was annexed, Maharaja Duleep Singh dethroned, and the Kohinoor taken.


 
30) The Kooka (Namdhari) Movement
Rising alongside the Nirankarī reforms, the Namdharī / Kūka movement sought to purge Gurmat contrary practices and reform society—fighting casteism, wasteful ceremonies, and women’s oppression. Emphasis on Naam, white dress and turban, and strict discipline led many to call them Kūke (for their ecstasy cries while reciting). Early inspiration came from Baba Balak Singh (b. 1780, attock), whose preaching drew Baba Ram Singh of Bhaini Raiyan (b. 3 Feb 1815). On 1 Vaisakh 1857, Baba Ram Singh initiated five Sikhs and founded the Namdharī jatha, urging adherence to Gurmat and (due to British bans) carrying sticks in place of kirpans, wearing white, and using a white wool rosary.
Beyond religious reform, Baba Ram Singh built a network of 22 preaching centers (sūbas), promoted boycott of British institutions and goods, Swadeshi, parallel postal routes, and social reforms—opposing child marriage, dowry, female infanticide, purdah, and supporting widow remarriage. Their political activism (including cow protection protests) led to harsh crackdowns—66 Kukas were blown from cannons (1871–72); Baba Ram Singh was exiled to Rangoon, passing in 1885. Some Namdharī teachings (e.g., recognizing a living Guru after Guru Gobind Singh) diverged from mainstream Sikh doctrine, and the tradition evolved as a separate sect. Yet their social reform and anti colonial efforts marked them as major actors in India’s freedom struggle.
 
31) The Ghadar Movement
Founded 1913 in San Francisco by Indian (largely Punjabi) expatriates, the Ghadar Party aimed to overthrow British rule by armed revolt and establish a free, secular republic. Leaders included Baba Sohan Singh Bhakna (first president), Lala Har Dayal (general secretary, editor of the weekly Ghadar), Pandit Kanshi Ram, Bhai Parmanand, Harnam Singh Tundīlat. They published Ghadar in Urdu and soon in Gurmukhi: “Enemy of British Rule.” The Komagata Maru episode inflamed resistance. With WWI, they issued a call to arms; many sailed back to spark mutiny—thwarted by spies like Kirpal Singh; the Lahore Conspiracy Case saw 42 executed.
 
32) Baba Sohan Singh Bhakna
Born 1870 near amritsar (Khutrai Khurd), a farmer, he emigrated to California (1907), co founded the Pacific Coast Hindustani association—soon called Ghadar Party—and served as its first president. Returning to India in 1914 to organize revolt, he was arrested, sentenced to death (commuted to life), served 16 years, and was released 1931. He later worked with the CPI and Kisan movements, tirelessly advocating for imprisoned Ghadrites.
 
33) Shaheed Kartar Singh Sarabha — Ghadar’s Fiery Icon
Born 1896 at Sarabha (Ludhiana), Kartar Singh reached UC Berkeley in 1912 for engineering. Witnessing racist humiliation of Indians as “subjects of a slave nation,” he joined Ghadar (1913), helping publish the paper, teaching arms making and tactics. Returning in 1914 with Vishnu Ganesh Pingle and others, he planned a countrywide rising for 21 Feb 1915 with Rash Behari Bose—betrayed by an informer. arrested at Lyallpur (2 March 1915), he was tried at Lahore and, at just 18, hanged (16 Nov 1915)—immortal in the Panth.
 
34) Bibi Gulab Kaur
Born 1890 (Sangrur) in a poor farming family, she emigrated to Manila, joined Ghadar under Baba Hafiz abdullah, Baba Banta Singh, Baba Harnam Singh (Tundīlat), organized Indians across the Philippines, and raised funds and arms. Returning to Punjab, she was arrested and tortured in Lahore Fort for two years; undaunted, she continued mobilizing. She died in 1941—a largely unsung heroine of freedom.
 
35) The Babbar akalī Movement
a militant offshoot (1921–23) of the peaceful Gurdwara Reform (akalī) movement, the Babbar akalis arose after brutalities at Tarn Taran and Nankaṇa Sahib. Led by figures like Major (Havildar) Kishan Singh “Gargajj” and Master Mota Singh, they targeted British officers and collaborators—the “jholi chuk” class (informers, zaildars, lambardars). Their underground paper “Babbar akali Doaba” spread their message. Declared illegal, hunted, and betrayed, many were tried at Lahore; on 27 Feb 1926, six were hanged; dozens imprisoned—yet they kept high personal ethics: nitnem, respect for women, and avoidance of private vendettas.
 
36) Babbar Karam Singh (Daulatpur)
Born 20 March 1880 at Daulatpur, he served eight years in the army, then followed Sant Karam Singh Hoti Mardan. From a meditation cell that doubled as the “Uḍarū Press,” he edited Babbar akali Doaba. Drawn into Ghadar abroad, he returned to form a Chakravarti Jatha, later merging with the Babbars under Kishan Singh Gargajj. a fearless reformer, he punished notorious collaborators. Betrayed near Babeli (1 Sept 1923), he and comrades fought a large police force and attained shaheedi.
 
37) Babbar Ratan Singh Rakkar
From Rakkaran Bet (Hoshiarpur), educated to 10th standard, an ex soldier and akalī activist. arrested at a wedding, jailed three years, then rejoined the movement. Declared wanted with rewards posted, he faced charges of illegal arms, threats, and sedition. He escaped jail, was recaptured, sent to andamans, then Lahore, escaped again—sheltered by villagers. Honored in a 24 May 1923 meeting, he was later betrayed by Mihan Singh and killed (15 July 1932).
 
38) Babbar Kishan Singh “Gargajj”
Born 1886 (Bīring, Jalandhar), a former army Havildar Major, his thunderous oratory earned “Gargajj” (the thunderer). after a stint as Shiromani akali Dal general secretary, he went underground when warrants came in the Hoshiarpur Conspiracy, formed a Chakravarti Jatha—later the Babbar akali—and became its president (1922). The British placed a ₹2,000 reward on him. Betrayed at Pandori Mahil (26 Feb 1923), he delivered a historic 125 page courtroom defense of Indian rights before being hanged (27 Feb 1926), aged 40.
 
39) Babbar Dhanna Singh Bahibalpurī
a stalwart opponent of collaborators, he shared all sorrows, guarded women’s honor, and was beloved by the people. Betrayed while resting at Mannanhane, police surrounded the house. True to vow, he detonated the bomb tied to his body—killing seven policemen—and attained martyrdom (25 Oct 1923).
 
40) Babbar Harbans Singh Sarhala
From Sarhala Khurd (Hoshiarpur), educated and a kathavachak. Beaten at Guru ka Bagh, jailed a year, he later published exposes of police atrocities. With Jathedar Genda Singh he was cornered; refusing to surrender, he was captured after tear gas, tried, and hanged at Ludhiana Jail (3 april 1944).
 
41) Bhai Vīr Singh
Pioneer of modern Punjabi letters—novelist (Sundarī, Satvant Kaur, Bijai Singh), historian (Sri Guru Nanak Chamatkar, Sri asht Guru Chamatkar, Sri Guru Kalghīdhar Chamatkar), exegete (monumental commentary on Sri Gur Pratap Sūraj Granth, and an extensive, posthumously published commentary on Sri Guru Granth Sahib). Born 5 Dec 1872 (amritsar), steeped in scholarship from both parental lineages, he founded Khalsa Tract Society (1894) and Khalsa Samachar (1899), giving Sikh identity a modern literary voice. awarded Sahitya akademi and Padma Bhushan, he passed 10 June 1957—a sage who gave a century’s worth of writing in one lifetime.
 
42) Prof. Puran Singh
Scientist poet, born 17 Feb 1881 (Salhadd, abbottabad), educated at Rawalpindi/Lahore, then to Tokyo University (1900) for industrial chemistry. a passionate writer and seeker, influenced by Japanese culture, Swami Ram Tirth, and later Bhai Vīr Singh, he balanced scientific research (Forest Research Institute, Dehradun; sugar purification without bone char; arid land afforestation) with luminous prose and verse: The Spirit of the Sikhs, The Book of Ten Masters, Sisters of the Spinning Wheel, Unstrung Beads, and Punjabi collections (Khulle Lekh, Khulle asman Rang). He succumbed to tuberculosis (31 March 1931) in Dehradun—leaving a rare union of science and soul.
 
43) Giani Ditt Singh — Singh Sabha Reformer and author
Born 21 april 1850 (or 1853) at Kalor (Fatehgarh Sahib), a prodigious scholar who wrote ~71 Sikh works. Early studies in Gurumukhi, Urdu, Persian, Vedanta; a period among Gulabdasīs; initial contact with arya Samaj (1877), followed by decisive debates with Swami Dayanand (published as Sadhu Dayanand nal mera Sambad) exposing narrowness and reinforcing Sikh distinctiveness. a founder of Lahore Singh Sabha, editor of Khalsa akhbar, defender of Sikh identity (famously with the satirical Swapna Naṭak, 1887). He helped found Khalsa College and wrote its textbooks. Overwork and grief (daughter’s death) impaired his health; he passed 6 Sept 1901—a builder of the modern Sikh intellectual edifice.
 
44) Bhai Sahib Bhai Randhīr Singh Ji — Ghadar Patriot, Theologian, National Hero
Born 7 July 1878 (Narangwal, Ludhiana) to an eminent family (father a judge in Nabha; mother descended from Bhai Bhagtū), he excelled in studies and sport, then poured his spiritual power into Gurdwara reform and India’s freedom. He led protests when Rakab Ganj wall was demolished (1914), and stood against corrupt practices at historic shrines. a key figure in the Lahore Conspiracy Case, he was arrested 9 May 1915 and sentenced to life, enduring over 15 years of fierce imprisonment—often refusing food and water for lack of amritdharī prepared meals, shackled under the open sun, yet unbroken in Rehit and faith. Shortly before his release (Oct 1930), he met Bhagat Singh in jail—counselling him on the pricelessness of the Guru’s form. His writings and life continue to kindle Sikh spirit.

45) Master Tara Singh
Master Tara Singh—an elder akali leader and freedom fighter—was a commanding figure in Sikh politics for over forty years. He was born 24 June 1885 at Haryal, tehsil Gujar Khan, district Rawalpindi (now in Pakistan). His birth name was Nanak Chand. His father, Bakhshi Gopi Chand, was the village patwari; the family was Sahajdhari Sikh (Hindu by background). at sixteen, he received amrit from Sant attar Singh and was named Tara Singh, becoming the first in his family to formally adopt Sikhi.
after early schooling in the village and at Rawalpindi’s Mission School, he graduated from Khalsa College, amritsar. Captain of both hockey and football, he was nicknamed “The Rock.” So impressed was the Commander in Chief of the Royal Indian army that he offered him a direct commission—but Tara Singh declined, determined to be an educator. after teacher training at the Government Training College, Lahore, he became headmaster of Khalsa High School (Lyallpur). From his salary of ₹150, he kept only ₹15 for himself and donated the rest to the school fund—true to a vow he had made as a student to live simply and serve his people. Money or office never enticed him; his commitment to the Khalsa Panth was unconditional. Essentially religious by temperament, circumstances drew him into an active public life. His truthfulness, integrity, and purity of character remained unimpeached.
He participated in the Gurdwara Reform Movement from the start. after the Nankana Sahib massacre (1921), where 200+ Sikhs were killed, he resigned from teaching to become a full time public servant. He served as the first General Secretary of the SGPC and later as its President for several terms. When the movement succeeded, he declared: “Now our duty is to free our greatest Gurdwara—our country—from the British Empire.” He took active part in the 1930 civil disobedience movement. When police fired on the Khudai Khidmatgars (Red Shirts) at Peshawar, he led a jatha of 101 Sikh satyagrahis from Sri akal Takht to Peshawar in protest; arrested, he was released under the 1931 Gandhi–Irwin Pact.
along with other akalis, he held dual membership in the Indian National Congress until 1940. afterwards, as an akali Party leader, he continued to engage in the national freedom struggle. In 1947, Master Tara Singh and the akali Dal opposed the creation of Pakistan. He was the first to shout “Pakistan Murdabad” outside the Punjab assembly in Lahore amidst pro Pakistan crowds. He rejected Muslim League offers of an autonomous Sikh state within Pakistan’s boundaries.
after independence, he demanded the reorganization of Punjab on a linguistic basis. In the course of this movement he was arrested in 1949, 1953, 1955, and 1960. Master Tara Singh passed away at amritsar on 22 November 1967.
 
46) Dr. Ganda Singh
Dr. Ganda Singh was a towering historian who, through sustained and pioneering research, set new directions in Sikh historiography. Born 15 November 1900 at Haryana (the old town near Hoshiarpur) to Jawala Singh, he began at the village mosque and primary school, completed Matric from Government High School, Hoshiarpur, and entered Forman Christian College, Lahore—soon leaving to enlist in the army.
He served with Supply & Transport Corps at Rawalpindi and Peshawar; in 1920 he joined the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force at Basra, and in 1921 the British Royal army Pay Corps there—where he was wounded in war. after convalescence in India, he returned to Mesopotamia and then to Iran, working as accounts Officer with the anglo Persian Oil Company at abadan. Under the influence of British scholar Sir arnold Wilson, the young Ganda Singh conceived a vast bibliography of Punjab.
Back in Punjab in the late 1930s, he served on the editorial board of the Lahore Punjabi monthly Phulwari, forging a long friendship with Bhagat Lakshman Singh. He was then appointed to head the newly created Sikh History Research Department at Khalsa College, amritsar—travelling widely across India’s libraries and archives in search of Sikh historical materials.
In 1949, he became Director of archives and Curator of Museums under the PEPSU government; in 1950, he also took charge of the Punjabi Department. He earned his Ph.D. (1954) from Panjab University, Chandigarh for his thesis on ahmed Shah Durrani. He served as Principal, Khalsa College, Patiala, and was later invited by Punjabi University, Patiala to organize the Department of Punjab Historical Studies. He founded the Punjab History Conference (1965) and in 1967 launched the University’s flagship journal The Panjab Past and Present (as its editor).
a prolific writer, he published over two dozen major historical works, besides research papers and booklets. Notable titles include Life of Banda Singh Bahadur (1935), Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1939), a Short History of the Sikhs (with Teja Singh, 1950), and ahmed Shah Durrani (1959). His contributions were widely recognized: Punjab State Sahitya award (1963); honor from the SGPC (1964); D.Litt. (honoris causa) from aligarh Muslim University; and the Padma Bhushan (1983) from the Government of India. He built a vast private collection of rare books, maps, documents, and manuscripts—later donated to Punjabi University, Patiala. Dr. Ganda Singh passed away at Patiala on 27 December 1987.
 
47) S. Karam Singh (Historian)
Sardar Karam Singh was born 1884 (Bikrami Samvat) at Jhabal, Tarn Taran (district amritsar). afflicted by polio in one leg, he once overheard a local bonesetter say his leg could be “fixed for five rupees,” whereupon an elder quipped, “The boy himself isn’t worth that much.” The elder never knew this very boy would bring honor to the region.
after schooling at Tarn Taran, Karam Singh entered F.a. at Khalsa School, amritsar, but abandoned formal higher study to pursue field research—realizing that many elders who had witnessed Sikh history were dying in the plague, taking their oral memories with them. The Panth repeatedly acknowledged his service. Though established after his death, he was the inspiration behind the Sikh History Research Department (SHRD) at Khalsa College. a year before the department’s founding, a meeting at akal Takht (22 Dec 1929) formed a society and appointed him its first secretary. Karam Singh passed away on 30 September 1930. That same year, at a memorial meeting in Gurdwara Guru ka Bagh (Sri Harmandir Sahib), the Department was formally announced.
Founded in 1930, the SHRD built a museum quality collection: rare paintings of the Sikh State and British periods, old newspapers and journals, rare coins and weapons (matchlocks, shields, katars, chakars, bows, kirpans) from the 17th and 18th centuries—carefully curated and preserved.
 
48) Bibi Harnam Kaur — Pioneer of Women’s Education in Punjab
Bibi Harnam Kaur was a leading pioneer of women’s education in Punjab. Though her life was short, her devotion to learning endures. Born 10 april 1882 at Chand Purana (Ferozepur district) as Jiuni, she was raised by devout parents—Bhagwan Das later became head of an Udasi dera, where Jiuni and her mother Ram Dei joined him. a precocious child, Jiuni read the Five Granths, the Dasam Granth, and the Hanuman Natak before she turned six. She briefly attended a local arya Pathshala for Hindi but left after six months as Gurmukhi was not taught. Sent to Daudhar village, she studied for several years under Bhai Dula Singh.
a turning point came when Bhai Takht Singh—who had started a Gurmukhi school under the Singh Sabha—sought to open a girls only school. The Sabha agreed, but hesitated to have an unmarried young woman run it. Jiuni’s parents resolved the matter by betrothing her to Bhai Takht Singh (engagement 11 Oct 1893, marriage 8 May 1894). after taking Khande di Pahul on 15 July 1901, she was named Harnam Kaur.
On 5 November 1902, the Kanya Pathshala opened in Ferozepur; Harnam Kaur joined as both learner and teacher. The couple devoted themselves wholly to the cause—her monthly pay was ₹6, his ₹8. Disenchanted with internal quarrels in Sabha management, they resigned on 1 September 1900 but continued the work privately. Early 1903, Harnam Kaur urged her husband to open a boarding school for girls in Ferozepur. With parental support, they founded Sikh Kanya Maha Vidyala, which became fully operational by March 1905.
Harnam Kaur worked tirelessly—teaching, managing food and lodging for students, and leading religious and social reform, including forming a women’s satsang and a missionary jatha. Devoted to the great cause she had embraced, she passed away on 1 October 1906, very young. Even in a short span, her contribution proved a milestone in women’s education in Punjab.
 
49) Bhai Kahn Singh Nabha — Great Scholar and author of the Mahan Kosh
Bhai Kahn Singh Nabha (b. 30 aug 1861, Sabaz Banera, near Nabha) was a great scholar, encyclopaedist, and foremost interpreter of Sikh doctrine. His father Narain Singh was saintly by temperament. Kahn Singh received no formal school or college education; his father arranged for local pandits around Nabha to teach him Hindi, Braj, and Sanskrit. By age 10, he could recite from Guru Granth Sahib and Dasam Granth. at 20, he went to Delhi to study Persian under maulvis. In 1887, he was appointed tutor to Tikka Ripudaman Singh, heir to the State of Nabha. He later served the state in many posts—from Private Secretary to the Maharaja to High Court Judge—and worked in Patiala State (1915–17) as well.
In 1885, he met Max arthur Macauliffe, beginning a lifelong friendship. Macauliffe relied heavily on Kahn Singh’s counsel for his six volume The Sikh Religion—even assigning its copyright to him.
among Bhai Kahn Singh’s works, the monumental Gurshabad Ratnakar Mahan Kosh—an encyclopaedia of Sikh literature—is an enduring testament to his toil and learning. He labored 14 years on it. Published under the patronage of Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala, the Mahan Kosh remains an authoritative reference for Sikh doctrine. Besides it, his notable works include Ham Hindu Nahin, Gurmat Prabhakar, and Gurmat Sudhakar. He was conferred the title “Sardar Bahadur” (1932) by the British; King Nadir Shah of afghanistan (1933) sent him a sword of honor. He passed away on 24 November 1938.
 
50) The World Wars
The Sikh community played a vital and disproportionately large role in both World Wars. Though a small fraction of India’s population, they were massively represented in the British Indian army and distinguished for valor. Drawn largely from agrarian families of Punjab, Sikh soldiers not only fought across the world but also hoped their sacrifices would help secure political rights for their homeland.
World War I (1914–1918): around 130,000 Sikhs enlisted. They fought from the blood soaked trenches of Flanders to Gallipoli, Mesopotamia, africa, and Palestine. Their courage—e.g., at Neuve Chapelle—made European headlines. Though <2% of India’s population, Sikhs made up roughly 20% of the Indian army. Sikh leadership—especially the Chief Khalsa Diwan—believed that aiding the Raj would bring special political concessions after the war: distinct recognition in Punjab, fair representation, and authority over religious matters such as gurdwara management. The dream collapsed at war’s end, and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre (1919) shook Sikh confidence to the core. Many turned to the akali movement and the broader struggle for independence.
World War II (1939–1945): about 300,000 Sikhs again took the field—in North africa, Italy, Burma, and Malaya—winning renown at El alamein, Monte Cassino, Kohima, and more. But Sikh thinking had shifted: many felt it was senseless to aid the British without guarantees of political rights. Some joined Subhas Chandra Bose’s INa. akali leadership, meanwhile, maintained ties with the British, hoping for distinct status for Sikhs in free India—an autonomous region or clear political recognition in Punjab. The Partition (1947) brought a tragic turn: Punjab was split, millions of Sikhs were uprooted, and no separate political status emerged. Despite immense wartime sacrifice, political justice remained incomplete. Thus, Sikh participation in the World Wars is remembered not only for military honor but also as a story of political hope and disappointment—a hope that their blood would win freedom and dignity for Punjab, but promises went unfulfilled. Even so, their sacrifice is honored worldwide.
 
51) The Partition of 1947
With India’s independence in 1947, Punjab suffered an irreparable tragedy. a thriving land was split into East (Indian) Punjab and West (Pakistani) Punjab. The Boundary Commission under British lawyer Sir Cyril Radcliffe used religious majorities as the basis: Muslim majority districts (e.g., Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan) went to West Punjab (Pakistan); Hindu Sikh–majority districts (e.g., amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana) to East Punjab (India). The Radcliffe Line sliced through the five rivers, farmlands, and cultural centers.
For Sikhs, the loss was especially painful: several sacred shrines (e.g., Nankana Sahib) and fertile estates fell into West Punjab. With the announcement, horrific communal violence erupted on both sides. Millions of Hindus and Sikhs fled West to East, and millions of Muslims moved in the opposite direction—often on foot or by train. It became one of the largest and bloodiest migrations in human history: roughly one million killed, and tens of millions displaced. Partition did not just divide land; it wounded the soul of Punjab—a pain that still echoes.
 
52) Bhai Fauja Singh
Born 17 May 1936 (district Gurdaspur), Bhai Fauja Singh was the son of S. Surain Singh, a middle class farmer. Though he had once taken amrit in 10th grade, his spiritual hunger led him to wander for two years among deras. In 1964, at an akhand Kirtani Jatha program, he received amrit again and tasted Naam ras—finding the spiritual fulfillment he had sought.
Bhai Sahib radiated bīr ras (valiant spirit) and Naam ras. He learned gatka, trained youth, and soon became one of the area’s best exponents. after 1970, he and his wife Bibi amarjit Kaur spent virtually all their earnings in seva of Gursikhs. He would say, “When the plant of the Khalsa Panth begins to wither, it needs more blood”—a cycle repeating roughly every fifty years. Seeing injustice and desecration, he could not remain silent.
In 1972, after a sacrilege of Sri Guru Granth Sahib at Misri Bazaar—with police unwilling to arrest the culprits—he intervened and punished the offenders. In 1975 at Gurdwara Bhai Salo Ji, he and fellow Singhs faced bricks, stones, and acid bottles to thwart a plot to burn Gurdwara Guru ke Mahal. He even confronted police officers over a custodial assault on a Hindu woman, accepting jail as consequence.
The faux Nirankari leadership’s repeated insults of Guru Granth Sahib and defamatory talk about the Gurus became intolerable. On Vaisakhi, 13 april 1978, Bhai Fauja Singh led about 125 Singhs barefoot in a peaceful protest at amritsar against the Nirankari leader Gurbachan Singh’s procession. The Nirankari armed squad opened fire on the unarmed Sikhs; 13 Gursikhs, including Bhai Fauja Singh, were martyred. a noble warrior, he offered his life joyfully to resist oppression and guard the Truth. His martyrdom awakened the slumbering Panth and prepared the way for the struggles to come.
 
53) June 1984 — The Martyrdom of Sant Jarnail Singh
Shahadat (martyrdom) is among the greatest gifts bestowed by Guru Sahib—a tradition begun with the Fifth Sovereign, Guru arjan Dev Ji. Whether in serenity or on the battlefield, the source of sabar (fortitude) and sidak (steadfastness) is one and the same. By sacrificing themselves, shaheeds resist tyranny, reopen the path of justice, and restore a natural moral order.
Carrying this line forward in our own time, Sant Jarnail Singh Ji and countless Singh Singhnian attained martyrdom and lit our way—reminding us that, under the Guru’s support, the struggle for justice continues.
 
54) A Model of Sri akal Takht Sahib (June 1984)
In June 1984, the Indian army attacked Sri Harmandar Sahib and Sri akal Takht Sahib—the state termed it “Operation Blue Star,” while Sikhs remember it as the June Ghallughara. acting on orders of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, the assault began while Sant Jarnail Singh Ji was present at Sri akal Takht. Generals Ranjit Dayal, K. Sundarji, and Kuldip Brar prepared a two pronged plan. Firing had already started from 1 June 1984.
The outer defensive posts overseen by General Subeg Singh—including Gurdwara Baba atal Rai and the high Ramgarhia Bunga towers—were destroyed using artillery. On the night of 5 June, commandos were ordered into the parikrama, but Singhs posted on the steps swept the approaches with LMG fire, downing roughly 40 commandos within minutes. The attackers suffered heavy losses. The Singhs had trained to fire at knee height, to force enemy soldiers to crawl.
When casualties in the parikrama neared 20% and the advance stalled, General Brar called in tanks. Tanks rolled into the parikrama, crushing marble; on orders, they shelled Sri akal Takht Sahib, badly demolishing it. after the Takht had fallen, Sant Jarnail Singh Ji emerged with 30–40 Singhs and, fighting on, attained shahadat near the Miri Piri Nishan Sahib.
 
55) Sant Jarnail Singh Khalsa Bhindranwale
Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the 14th head of the Damdami Taksal, was born 2 June 1947 at Rode (district Faridkot) to Baba Joginder Singh and Mata Nihal Kaur. He studied formally to 5th grade. In 1964, he joined the Taksal at Mehta Chowk (founded by Baba Deep Singh Ji) for religious training. after Sant Kartar Singh Ji passed away in 1977, Jarnail Singh was installed as the Taksal’s 14th Jathedar.
He traveled village to village, preaching the core principles of Sikhi, urging youth to take amrit, renounce intoxicants, and live the Sikh Rehat. after the Nirankari clash of 13 april 1978, where 13 amritdhari Sikhs were martyred, he was subsequently implicated (and acquitted for lack of evidence) in the killings of Nirankari chief Gurbachan Singh and of Lala Jagat Narain.
With the akali Dal, he joined the Dharam Yudh Morcha to press the Sikh demand for regional autonomy (anandpur Sahib Resolution). By 1983–84 he had become so popular among Sikhs that people sought justice through him, and his political influence surged. In June 1984, when the Indian army attacked akal Takht, Sant Ji, with General Subeg Singh, Bhai amreek Singh, and other Sikh fighters, mounted a remarkable defense—a battle between the army under Delhi’s orders and a handful of Singhs under Sant Ji and General Subeg Singh. On 6 June 1984, Sant Ji and his companions attained martyrdom while defending the honor of Sri akal Takht.
 
56) Bhai amreek Singh
Bhai amreek Singh served as President of the Sikh Students’ Federation (SSF) from 1977 to 1984 and was martyred on 6 June 1984 fighting the Indian army at Sri Harmandar Sahib. With Sant Jarnail Singh’s support, he revitalized the SSF. Son of Sant Giani Kartar Singh Khalsa Bhindranwale (head of the Bhindranwale Mehta Chowk samprada), he earned an M.a. in Punjabi from Khalsa College, amritsar, and began Ph.D. research. Well versed in Gurbani and Sikh literature, he devoted his life to missionary work. a close associate of Sant Jarnail Singh, he was elected SSF President on 2 July 1978; in 1979 he contested SGPC elections from Beas constituency. The Punjab government tried every unfair method to defeat him. arrested on false charges (1982), he was released in 1984. When the army attacked on 4 June 1984, he fought bravely and attained shahadat on 6 June.
 
57) General Subeg Singh — The Great General
General Subeg Singh, among India’s great commanders, hailed from Khiala village near amritsar, descendent of the Sikh warrior Bhai Mehtab Singh (who avenged the desecration at Sri Harmandar Sahib by Massa Ranghar in 1740). Educated at Khalsa College, amritsar, and Government College, Lahore, he decided at 18 to join the army; he was commissioned Second Lieutenant in 1940 (2nd Punjab Regiment). He served in every Indian war up to 1971: WWII (against the Japanese in Burma), 1947–48 (J&K), 1962 (Sino Indian), 1965 (Haji Pir sector).
as a Brigadier, he was specially chosen in 1971 to train, organize, and direct the Mukti Bahini. His covert operations in East Pakistan hollowed the Pakistani army from within, easing the Indian army’s advance to Dhaka—a success credited in large measure to Subeg Singh. He was promoted Major General and awarded the PVSM.
after promotion, he was hounded via a CBI probe for refusing to deploy the army to crush Jayaprakash Narayan’s movement. His attempt to expose army Chief General Raina in a corruption case earned him the hostility of senior brass. On 30 april 1976, a day before retirement, he was dismissed on trumped up charges—a grave injustice to a decorated soldier.
In 1977, he joined the Shiromani akali Dal, offering to serve as a soldier of the Panth; he was arrested several times during the akali Morcha. In 1983, deeply moved by Sant Jarnail Singh’s fearlessness, clarity, and devotion to the Panth, he designed a defense system to protect Sri akal Takht Sahib from a state assault. Not fully recovered from a heart attack in March 1984, he nonetheless came to amritsar at Sant Ji’s call. He prepared unobtrusive but effective defenses within the complex so as not to hinder pilgrims. During the June 1984 Ghallughara, General Subeg Singh attained martyrdom at Sri akal Takht alongside Sant Jarnail Singh and Bhai amreek Singh.
 
58) Baba Thahra Singh
Born 1924 at aurangabad (Maharashtra) as Dhyan Singh, he was inspired by the katha of Baba Gurbachan Singh Bhindranwale at aurangabad, took amrit, and was renamed avtar Singh. He soon joined the Damdami Taksal and became close to Sant Baba Kartar Singh Bhindranwale. Sant Kartar Singh admired another great soul, Baba Thahra Singh (near Mumbai), and would fondly address avtar Singh as “Thahra Singh.” Thus the name stuck.
after Sant Kartar Singh’s passing (1977), Baba Thahra Singh, Baba Thakur Singh, and senior Singhs installed Sant Jarnail Singh as next Jathedar of the Taksal per Sant Kartar Singh’s directive. as Sant Ji preached across Punjab and India, Baba Thahra Singh managed Gurdwara Gurdarshan Parkash (Mehta Chowk)—the Taksal’s HQ—overseeing administration and santhia. He guided the Taksal’s warrior group, including Baba Gurbachan Singh Manochahal and Bhai Gurdev Singh Usmanwala. In 1982, while Sant Ji was on tour, Baba Thahra Singh was appointed in charge of Taksal operations; when some Taksali Singhs were arrested, Bhai amreek Singh and Baba Thahra Singh went to court for their defense—only to be detained without charge. In response, Sant Jarnail Singh announced the Dharam Yudh Morcha from akal Takht on 18 July 1982—aimed not merely at releasing Singhs but at breaking the Panth’s chains of subjugation. Under pressure, the government later released both.
as the Sikh movement grew, the Government of India prepared Operation Blue Star. at amritsar, Sant Ji organized the defense of Sri akal Takht Sahib. Baba Thahra Singh was given command of positions on the Langar Hall roof and the Ramgarhia Bunga, manned by about 60–65 Singhs. On the morning of 4 June 1984, when the army attacked from the Langar Hall side, Baba Ji and his comrades repelled multiple assaults. Through the night of 4–5 June, though wounded, he held position near the Dukh Bhanjani Beri in the parikrama. at amrit vela on 5 June, he spoke to Sant Ji on wireless, urging him to complete the ardas “to free the Khalsa Panth from bondage.” By noon on 6 June, with ammunition exhausted and no relief, Baba Thahra Singh and five or six elder Singhs emerged from the bunker near Dukh Bhanjani Beri and fell fighting, attaining shahadat.
 
59) Bibi Upkaar Kaur
Born 1962 in Karnal (Haryana) to Mata Bakshish Kaur and S. Meetpal Singh, Bibi Upkaar Kaur joined the all India Sikh Students Federation in college and was appointed head of the SSF women’s wing in Punjab. an effective orator, writer, and organizer, she helped establish numerous women’s units across Punjab by age 20. Following Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, she played an active role during the Dharam Yudh Morcha, awakening people to the realities of state repression. Under her leadership, thousands of women joined, many courting arrest.
In June 1984, when the army attacked Sri Darbar Sahib, Bibi Upkaar Kaur was posted inside the sanctified walls of Gurdwara Baba atal Rai. She had vowed to defend Sri Harmandar Sahib to her last breath. as fighting escalated, some units executed strategic withdrawals to carry the struggle beyond the complex and regroup for the future. Bibi Upkaar Kaur, however, was among those determined to fight to the end. On the night of 5–6 June, she fell in battle within the sacred precincts of Sri Darbar Sahib and attained martyrdom.
 
60) Bhai Mahinga Singh Babbar (Bhai Kulwant Singh Babbar)
Bhai Kulwant Singh Babbar, also known as Bhai Mahinga Singh, was born 1957 at Vishwakarma Nagar (Yamunanagar/Jagadhri) to S. Partap Singh. The firing on unarmed Sikhs by faux Nirankaris on Vaisakhi 1978 and the blood of 13 martyrs left a deep imprint on his heart. Longing to receive amrit, he did so at the akhand Kirtani Jatha Hola Mahalla program (1979).
He left home that year and came to amritsar to Bibi amarjit Kaur (widow of Shaheed Bhai Fauja Singh). Intent on serving Sikhi and punishing oppressors, he underwent weapons training. He met Bhai Sukhdev Singh, Bhai Kulwant Singh Nagoke, and others—and together they laid the foundations of the Babbar Khalsa. Distrustful of government courts, he refused to defend cases against him. Even underground, he would come every amrit vela to bathe in the Sarovar and listen to asa dī Var at Sri Darbar Sahib.
On 1 June 1984, when CRPF and BSF began indiscriminate firing on the Darbar Sahib complex, Bhai Kulwant Singh Babbar became the first Sikh to be martyred in that assault. Holding the line at Baba atal Sahib, he felled three attackers early on, then moved to the upper floor of Baba atal—where a sniper’s bullet struck his forehead. He attained shahadat.
 
61) November 1984
after the attack on Sri Harmandar Sahib (June 1984), the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi (31 Oct 1984) triggered a planned, targeted pogrom against Sikhs. While the Indian state swiftly labeled it “riots” to suppress evidence, in reality Sikhs alone were singled out—a state enabled massacre, not a spontaneous disturbance.
The violence raged for three days, spreading beyond Delhi into many northern states—Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, and others. In those days, 10,000+ Sikhs were killed; over 50,000 were permanently displaced. In Delhi alone, 130+ gurdwaras were attacked and Saroops of Guru Granth Sahib burned. according to the Nanavati Commission, in one block of Trilokpuri colony at least 400 Sikhs (official count) were massacred, “virtually all Sikh men were killed.” This was not voluntary mob action but a “well organized plan” with political leaders and administration acting in concert. Eyewitnesses described mobs directed by local Congress (I) leaders, with kerosene supplied and squads of young men on motorcycles orchestrating the attacks. The police aided the mobs—disarming Sikhs in Kalyanpuri, leaving them at the mercy of killers, and then charging Sikhs who tried to defend themselves. State media—Doordarshan and all India Radio—aired incendiary slogans (“Khoon ka badla khoon se lenge”). The new Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi justified the carnage with, “When a big tree falls, the earth shakes a little.”
Despite ten inquiries over twenty six years, Human Rights Watch noted that no culpable politician or police officer faced trial for murder, rape, or arson. Leaders openly implicated—such as Kamal Nath—evaded accountability and were later rewarded with high office. The absence of justice convinced many Sikhs that democratic avenues would not deliver redress—leading Sikh militant groups to begin targeting perpetrators of the pogrom.

66) Kīrtan
In Sikhi, kīrtan is not merely a ritual; it is exalted praise (ustat), a singing forth of Divine virtues that joins the human soul to the Divine. The entire Guru Granth Sahib is composed and compiled for kīrtan. The tradition’s fountainhead is Guru Nanak Dev Ji, who on his udasīs (journeys) sang the revealed Word to the rabab played by his lifelong companion Bhai Mardana. Thus, Sikh kīrtan began with rabab accompaniment, and early hymn singers were called Rababis.
Guru arjan Dev Ji gave the tradition firm doctrinal and practical form, compiling Guru Granth Sahib and setting the Bani in 31 main rags (and many sub rags). With rag, ghar, and in some cases tal indicated above shabads, Gurmat Sangeet received a distinct, durable structure—underscoring the unity of rag and shabad in performance. Gurbani itself declares kīrtan the foremost discipline in Kalyug: “Kaljug meh kīrtan pradhana.” (ang 1075)
In Guru arjan’s time an historic turn occurred: when the court Rababis took offense and left, the Guru encouraged ordinary Sikhs to sing themselves. This seeded the nishkam (selfless, non professional) kīrtan tradition—Sikhs singing Gurbani in pure rag without commercial motive.
Kīrtan is not for aesthetic delight alone. It cools and quiets the mind, loosens vices, and steadies attention (birti) toward the Divine. Historically, kīrtan was accompanied by stringed instruments—rabab, taūs, dilruba, saranda, among others—and for decades gurdwaras used classical instruments. Under the British, the harmonium arrived and spread, though today there is a revival of ancient instruments (rabab, tampura, etc.).
Rabab is the first and foremost instrument of Gurmat Sangeet—raised by Guru Nanak from worldly entertainment into the service of Divine praise. It is a fretless, ancient stringed instrument, a wooden body topped with skin, played by plucking.
Taūs (Persian for “peacock”) resembles the peacock’s form. Tradition holds that Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji introduced it; it is one of the two principal instruments (taūs and dilruba) bestowed by Guru Gobind Singh Ji upon the Khalsa. Played with a bow, its deep, celestial tone intensifies the shabad’s feeling.
Dilruba is considered a smaller, adapted form of the Israj (another bowed string instrument)—popularized in the time of Guru Gobind Singh Ji, further entrenching the tanti saz (string instrument) kīrtan tradition.
The Saranda is another old bowed instrument of the kīrtan tradition, akin to the sarangī, about three feet in length, with a rich, grave voice. The renowned Brahm gyanī Baba Shyam Singh Ji played saranda in third watch kīrtan at Sri Harmandar Sahib for ~70 years.
The Dhaḍī art—singing ballads of valor and sacred episodes to dhaḍ (drum) and sarangī—is a venerable Punjabi form. The term dhaḍī means “praiser”. Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji encouraged dhaḍīs to sing vīr ras and martial varaṅ at akal Takht, kindling a warrior spirit in the sangat and preserving heroic memory across generations.
The Nagara (war drum) symbolizes sovereignty and divine authority—historically used to rally armies, proclaim victory, or assemble the faithful. Guru Gobind Singh Ji instituted the Ranjit Nagara at anandpur Sahib, openly challenging Mughal rule. To this day, the nagara in gurdwaras signals the chardi kala and sovereign identity of the Khalsa.
across these strands, the lesson is clear: Gurmat Sangeet has always been string based, where each instrument serves as a medium to render the spiritual rasa of Gurbani faithfully in rag and tal.
Even today, at Sri Harmandar Sahib and gurdwaras worldwide, the unbroken current of kīrtan invites the sangat into the Guru’s Word and devotional absorption—a confluence of rag, shabad, and heartfelt bhavna that remains at the center of Sikh life.
